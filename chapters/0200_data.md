Data
====


+   What data the user should be able to manage or to control?
+   request should contain a specific value for how precise a certain data should 
    be (e.g. location)
+   differentiate between data the user has and collects about herself, and data others have/create
    on the user (e.g. doctors/e-health, banks, public authorities) - depending on that, how does
    the data get into the system?
+   data precision/resolution? (maybe it might be legit to say: the more precise the data is, the 
    higher the (selling) value)
+   when responding with data, the contents should be labeled with an expire date, set by the
    owner of the data
    
+   NOTE, in reality, certain business processes might require to store some data, e.g. for legal
    a/o administrative reasons - address to reproduce where amazons package went 



## Data Categories

__NOTE:__ does not mean data types!

+   profile data
+   sensor data (e.g. geo-location, motions)
+   financial record (and history)
+   payment information
+   medical record
+   governmental data
+   biometric datasets (e.g. finger print, retina)
+   web search history
+   what about user-created content, like pictures, videos or blog posts?

[A-middleware-architecture-for-privacy-protection_2007 p4r] suggests:
+   active
+   semi-active
+   passive



## Data types

+   String (number, boolean) - single values, which can go into the db
+   serialized data structure (as string); requires schema upfront
+   data series based on time (recurring data with familiar structure and purpose)
+   files - text or binary - need to get written to a filesystem and referenced by link with a
    db entry OR gets stored directly into the db



## Dev API

+   devs can registering new data types by providing a type name, description and a schema
+   querying data by using graphql would provide the ability to ask fine-granted and structured
    based on a schema-like way
+   every schema needs a version; we need to store every schema version
