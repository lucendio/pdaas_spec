### providing self-collected (meta) data

+   when handing over large amount of meta data (e.g. geo location log over time), these data have
    to be anonymized before leaving the system (see: MITs *openPDS* project, more precisely 
    *SafeAnswer*)
+   there have to be a protocol for such a process (details on what data they exactly need)

+   end-to-end encryption everywhere, or when its sufficient transport encryption only?
